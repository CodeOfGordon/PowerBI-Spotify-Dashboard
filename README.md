# PowerBI Spotify Dashboard

## The Process

- This project started with grabbing data on the most streamed 2024 songs from a public kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2024/code)

- Next I wrote a script to grab all the cover image urls by using the Spotify API

- Afterwards, I designed the dashboard template by making a powerpoint, while also thinking about what I might want to emphasize

- On the actual PowerBI dashboard, I used power query to format and help create the date table

- Then I began thinking about what data I wanted to visualize, and creating DAX equations for them

- I ended the project by prettifying a ton, formatting it with colors and transparency. Pretty proud of it myself.
